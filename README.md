## How It Was Made
This web app was originally made by Thuc Chi Do ([thucchi-cs](https://github.com/thucchi-cs))

This website was made with `Python`, `JavaScript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`. I used `Flask` to handle routing in this app. `psycopg2` was used to connect to my online `PostgreSQL` on `Neon`. This website is also deployed on `Render`.
